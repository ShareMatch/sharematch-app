# 🚀 Weekly Recap: Blockchain Scoping, Strategic Demos & The New Signup Flow
**Date:** December 14, 2025

Team, incredible execution. It’s been a massively bullish week. Since our last update, we have completed a backend overhaul, successfully demoed to key partners, and delivered a seamless new onboarding experience.

Here is some of what we achieved:

## 🤝 1. Strategic Milestones (Huge Wins)
*   **Shariah Compliance:** Successful demo to the Shariah Compliance team on Tuesday. The platform was well received, validating our rigorous adherence to "Real Utility" principles.
*   **Saudi Partnership:** Richard delivered an in-person demo to our Saudi partners on Wednesday, showcasing the live platform capabilities.
*   **Blockchain Architecture:** We have fully scoped out the blockchain structure that will underpin our next phase of transparency and settlement.

## ⚙️ 2. Core Infrastructure (Major Milestone)
*   **Database Migration:** Fully migrated and normalized the entire backend to `sm-core-stg`. User profiles, compliance data, and OTP logs are now separated and scalable.
*   **Security Hardening:** Row Level Security (RLS) is now enforced across all tables, and hardcoded secrets have been stripped from the codebase.
*   **Wallet Logic:** Fixed critical logic in `place_trade` to ensure funds are deducted immediately upon order placement, correcting net wealth calculations.

## ✨ 3. The New Signup Experience (New Today)
*   **Seamless Onboarding:** The "Join Now" flow has been completely refined with a seamless "Brand Green" (#005430) interface—no more boxes or borders.
*   **Messaging:** Updated tagline to "Real Markets. Real Transparency."
*   **Technical Fixes:** Resolved display layering issues (z-index) to ensure the modal sits perfectly above all other elements.

## 🔍 4. Search & Discovery
*   **Global Search:** The sidebar search bar is now live! Users can find any asset across any market instantly.
*   **Voice Integration:** Implemented native Voice-to-Text—you can now speak to search on mobile. 🎙️
*   **Smart Context:** Search results now intelligently distinguish between markets (e.g., "Arsenal • EPL" vs "Arsenal • UCL").

## 🛡️ 5. Compliance & KYC Engine
*   **Identity Tech:** Integrated Sumsub SDK (Sandbox) for full document verification and liveness checks.
*   **Self-Correction:** Users can now correct their email or phone number mid-flow during onboarding if they make a typo, reducing drop-off.
*   **Acceptance Gates:** "Terms & Conditions" and "Risk Statements" are now integrated directly into the trade flow.

## 🎨 6. UI & Polish
*   **Rebrand:** Deployed the full Corporate Green (#005430) theme across Headers, Sidebars, and Order Books.
*   **Financial Clarity:** Added explicit $ prefixes to all prices and "Realizable Value" tooltips to reinforce our asset-backed positioning.
*   **AI Upgrade:** Switched News & Analytics engines to Gemini 2.5 Flash for faster performance.

## 🧪 Action Items for Monday:
*   **Critical "Secret Shopper" Test:** Please sign up with a fresh email as if you were a new customer. This is our primary focus before the first pitch call on Monday evening.
*   **Identify Friction:** Note any hesitation, typos, or confusing steps during the onboarding process.
*   **Verify Features:** Test Voice Search and check the new highly visual Trending Markets on mobile.
*   **Account Profile Page LIVE**

Another strong week down. We are moving fast:
