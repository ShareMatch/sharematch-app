# 🚀 Weekly Recap: AI Dominance, Scalable Architecture & The Asset Experience
**Date:** December 21, 2025

Team, another massive week. We have successfully bridged the gap between a robust, scalable backend and a hyper-engaging, AI-driven frontend. The platform is now visually stunning, deeper than ever, and built on a foundation ready for mass scale.

Here is what we achieved since December 15th:

## 1. The Asset Experience (Major Frontend Delivery)
We have transformed the platform from a simple dashboard into a deep research tool.
*   **Dedicated Asset Pages:** Every asset (e.g., *Arsenal*, *Israel*) now has its own dedicated terminal featuring price charts, trade history, and news.
*   **AI-Driven Insights:**
    *   **"Did You Know?":** Context-aware AI guarantees unique, non-sensitive facts for every asset, persisted to our database for performance.
    *   **"On This Day":** A new historical engine that generates timely facts (e.g., "On this day in 2013, Liverpool scored five goals..."), driving daily user engagement.
*   **Smart News Feed:** We fixed the "blank feed" issues. The engine now intelligently filters news, ensuring premier league pages show relevant team news (Liverpool, Chelsea checks) without noise.

## 2. Proprietary AI Architecture (RAG Engine) 🤖
This isn't just a chatbot; it is a fully bespoke **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** engine.
*   **Vector-Native Knowledge Base:** We engineered a custom pipeline using **Chroma Cloud** to vectorize our proprietary documentation (Whitepapers, Compliance Docs, FAQs). The system performs semantic similarity searches to retrieve exact context before answering.
*   **Zero Hallucination:** By grounding the LLM in our specific vector embeddings, users can query complex topics—from Shariah compliance to settlement mechanics—and get legally accurate answers.


## 3. Core Architecture Overhaul (The "Hidden" Win)
Our database infrastructure has been completely re-architected for scale.
*   **Scalable Market Hierarchy:** We moved from a flat structure to a robust `Groups -> Markets -> Indexes -> Seasons` hierarchy. This allows us to spin up *any* new market (e.g., Cricket, Esports) without code changes.
*   **Layered Data Availability:** Trading logic is now decoupled from display logic. Frontend calls are optimized to fetch specific market slices (`market_index_trading_assets`), ensuring lightning-fast load times even with thousands of assets.
*   **Environment Maturity:** We now have a true distinct pipeline:
    *   **Dev (`sm-core-dev`):** For local feature building.
    *   **Staging (`sm-core-stg`):** A persistent staging URL (`stg-rwa.sharematch.me`) for reliable partner demos.
    *   **Production (`sm-core-prod`):** Locked down and secure.

## 4. Security & Compliance
*   **RLS Everywhere:** Row Level Security is now strictly enforced across all tables.
*   **Logic Fixes:** Fixed critical wallet logic in `place_trade` to ensure instant and accurate wealth deduction.

## 🧪 Action Items for Monday
*   **Review the Index Pages:** Check out the new "Did You Know" and "On This Day" widgets on the Premier League page.
*   **Test the Chatbot:** Try switching modes and asking about specific assets.
*   **Verify Asset Deep Links:** Click through from the Order Book to an Asset Page and verifying the routing.

Values are real. The tech is real. We are ready.

**LFG.** 🚀
