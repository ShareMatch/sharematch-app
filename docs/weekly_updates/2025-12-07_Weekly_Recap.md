# 🚀 ShareMatch Platform Update: Vision App Launch & Core System Upgrades
**Date:** December 7, 2025

Hi all, ahead of another productive week coming up here's the end of week update. Thanks for all the efforts in making this happen ...

Team, massive progress since the last update. We’ve launched the standalone Strategic Vision App and deployed a comprehensive suite of features, compliance engines, and market expansions to the Main Platform.

## 🌐 1. Strategic Vision App (New Launch)
*   **URL:** https://vision.sharematch.me
*   **Investor Deck:** Interactive pitch deck for Series A/Seed conversations.
*   **Core Positioning:** "Digital Markets" platform & "Asset-Backed" framework. All legacy/gambling terminology eradicated.
*   **Key Features:** Interactive Tech Stack visualization, Capital Roadmap, and Valuation Defense.

## 🌐 2. Main Platform (rwa.sharematch.me)
*   **URL:** https://rwa.sharematch.me

### 🤖 AI & Analytics Engine
*   **Gemini Integration:** Real-time AI market analysis now live (Token Holder access).
*   **Tone Calibration:** Calibrated for implicit text-compliance—uses "Top the Index" vs "Win", removes explicit religious labels while maintaining strict alignment.

### 📈 Markets & Ticker
*   **New Leagues:** NBA and NFL added.
*   **Smart Ticker:** Implemented round-robin logic to ensure diverse exposure (EPL, F1, SPL) without repetition.
*   **Terminology:** "Trending Markets" updated to "Will [Team] Top the Index?" with clear "Buy/Sell" actions.

### 🛡️ Compliance & Safety
*   **Content Filtering:** Global Sports Wire now automatically strips non-compliant terms (e.g., promo codes, gambling/alcohol references).
*   **Regulatory Alignment:** Strengthening of all platform language to ensure Shariah compliance.

### 👤 UX & Onboarding
*   **New User Journey:** Sign Up → Email Verification → WhatsApp Verification → Account Created.
*   **Auth Flow:** Cleaned up Login/Signup modals; "Target Regions" (e.g., Saudi Arabia) now prioritized in selection lists.
*   **Sidebar Refinement:** New white-on-green logo, reordered to prioritize core value: Home, Sports, E-Sports (Coming Soon).

### 🔧 Critical Fixes
*   **Portfolio Sync:** Resolved database ID mismatch ensuring real-time portfolio updates after trades.
*   **AI Access:** Fixed API key configuration for analysis generation.

## 🧪 Action Items:
*   Please review the new **Onboarding Flow** and **AI Analytics** on the main site.
*   Check the **Strategic Deck** on mobile to ensure all animations are smooth.

Let's go! 🚀
