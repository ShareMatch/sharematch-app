          <p>Trades on the Secondary Market may result in a change to your tax position, which may include but not be limited to in respect of SEIS, EIS, capital gains tax, stamp duty and/or stamp duty reserve tax, or such equivalent taxes in another jurisdiction. Please note that if you are selling SEIS or EIS eligible shares prior to the end of the three-year period from the date they were issued to you, you will be liable to repay any tax relief already claimed. If you are buying shares on the Secondary Market, you will not be able to claim SEIS or EIS relief in respect of those shares and, if you subsequently purchase newly issued shares in the same business while you still hold the shares you bought on the Secondary Market, you will not be able to claim SEIS or EIS relief in respect of the newly issued shares. You are entirely responsible for the payment of any applicable taxes, and we shall bear no responsibility whatsoever in respect of them (including, notifying you that they have or may have arisen), except in relation to shares in businesses registered in England and Wales that are traded for a total purchase price of over £1,000, in which case ShareMatch shall pay the applicable stamp duty to HMRC and file the relevant stock transfer form. For the avoidance of doubt, for businesses registered outside England and Wales, you shall be responsible for paying any tax equivalent to stamp duty in that jurisdiction that arises when the shares are traded. Without prejudice to the foregoing, we reserve the right not to register a trade on the Secondary Market until we have been provided with evidence of a stock transfer form stamped by HMRC, or equivalent for businesses in a jurisdiction outside of England and Wales.</p>
