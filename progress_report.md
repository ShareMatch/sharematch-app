# ShareMatch Technical Progress Report

**Date:** December 7, 2025
**Project:** Premier League Performance Index (ShareMatch)

## 1. Executive Summary
We have successfully built a functional MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for ShareMatch, a high-frequency sports trading platform. The application allows users to trade virtual shares of a sports team's performance within that index across multiple leagues (EPL, NBA, F1, etc.) based on real-time performance data. The system features a responsive dark-mode UI, real-time proprietary order books, and integrated AI analytics.

## 2. Technology Stack

### Frontend Architecture
*   **Framework:** React 19 (via Vite) - utilizing the latest React features for high performance.
*   **Language:** TypeScript - ensuring type safety and code reliability.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS - implementing a custom "Emerald & Amber" dark-mode brand identity with responsive design for mobile and desktop.
*   **Icons:** Lucide React - consistent and lightweight UI iconography.
*   **State Management:** React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`) with custom state-based routing for instant page transitions.

### Backend & Infrastructure
*   **Platform:** Supabase - providing a serverless backend suite.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL - handling relational data for Users, Assets, Orders, and Portfolios.
*   **Authentication:** Supabase Auth - secure email/password registration and login management.
*   **Real-time:** Supabase Realtime - powering live ticker updates, order book changes, and immediate wallet balance reflection.
*   **Edge Functions:** Deno-based serverless functions for critical business logic (e.g., market seeding, complex trade matching - *implied infrastructure*).

### AI & Data Integration
*   **AI Engine:** Google Gemini (via `@google/genai`) - embedded directly into the dashboard to provide:
    *   Real-time "AI Analysis" of team performance.
    *   Predictive insights for the "AI Analytics Engine" module.
*   **Data Sources:** Structured data seeding (`seedSports.ts`) for multi-sport support (Football, Basketball, Racing, etc.).

## 3. Application Modules & Features
